#### Dev tools

You'll need to go ahead and install Node.js.
Once Node.js is installed, run npm install to install the rest of the template's dependencies. All dependencies will be
downloaded to the node_modules directory.

```bash copy
pnpm install
```

Now you're ready to modify the source files and generate new files. To automatically detect file changes and start a
local webserver at http://localhost:5173, run the following command.

```bash copy
pnpm dev
```

Compile, optimize, minify and uglify all source files to build

```bash copy
pnpm build
```
